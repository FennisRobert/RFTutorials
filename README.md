# RFTutorials
Free open-source RF design tutorials using the EMerge and other RF simulation tools!


# How to use?

You have to install a Jupyter notebook kernel. For VSCode it is adviced to install the Jupyter extension. If you have issues with no kernels showing up, do the following steps:
 - Go to the extension page of the Jupyter extension
 - Right from the install/uninstall and update button there is a gearwheel, click it a go for "install a specific version"
 - Click one of the later releases (2025+).
 - Restart the kernel after installation

Simply download the respository and run the noteboks locally on your computer!

# Installing dependencies
Please install the following to run these notebooks:
```bash
pip install emerge heavi jupyter ipykernel
```

# How to contribute?
The goal of this repository is for people to write their own tutorials explaining concepts in an interactive manner. 

There are some basic guidelines that I think are important:

## General Rules
 1. None yet

## Emerge related simulations
 1. Make sure that simulation ran in these notebooks can be quickly done with the basic SuperLU solver
